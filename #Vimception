#Vimception

###what is Vim?
 • Vi IMproved - a free, opensource text editor for unix.
 • Vim aims to minimize the number of keystrokes.
 • Base on vi which was designed to be used over slow terminals.
 • First released publicly in 1991. (Vi released 1976)
###why use a command line text editor (such as Vim or Emacs)?
 • Vi - on all POSIX compliant systems
    ◦ If you know Vim you can stumble you way around Vi
 • light on RAM
    ◦ Raw - 2MB
    ◦ With my plugins - 4MB
 • speed
    ◦ No need to move your hand from the home keys - scrolling, selecting, moving the cursor
    ◦ Changing blocks
    ◦ repeat character, and macros
 • cross over to:
    ◦ IDE
    ◦ terminal pager (used by less, man, etc)
    ◦ commande line
    ◦ browser (Vimium)
 • customisability and super mega rad pluggins
    ◦ vimscript
    ◦ vim-gitgutter
    ◦ autopairs
    ◦ ctrl-p
    ◦ vim-surround 
    ◦ language specific pluging
 • speed of updates
    ◦ neovim

###why you wouldn't use vim
 • Editing files with really really long lines
 • You can't touch type
 • ?Emacs style shortcuts are enabled in the commandline by default?

####~/.inputrc
{{{sh
$include /etc/inputrc
set completion-ignore-case On
set editing-mode vi set keymap vi-command

# many more commands to be found here: http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl3_readline.htm
$if mode=vi

  set keymap vi-command
  # these are for vi-command mode
  Control-l: clear-screen

  set keymap vi-insert
  # these are for vi-insert mode
  Control-l: clear-screen
  Control-p: previous-history
  "jk": vi-movement-mode
$endif
}}}

###how to get started
 • Peepcode screencast - Smash into Vim (https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/smash-into-vim)
 • The suggested order of addoption:
    ◦ movement keys and getting in and out of insert mode
       ▸ move a little: <esc><c-c>iv, hjkl (disable arrow keys if you have to)
       ▸ move a bit further: <c-d><c-u> w b $ ^ {}
       ▸ jump: fFtT;
       ▸ search: /?np
    ◦ operator pending keys:
       ▸ delete or change stuff: dc
    ◦ learn to use the clipboard
    ◦ install ctrl-p with pathogen

 • I've heard good things about vim tutor (http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)

###how to get fast
 • Get faster a touch typing
 • Disable crutch keys (arrows, backspace, or any other key you use when you could use something faster)
    ◦ Don't hold, or press a key multiple times in a row. (Disable these keys if you have to)
 • install vimium extension in the chrome
    ◦ if weak at touch typing digits, enable the option "Use the link's name and numbers for link-hint filtering"

###tips
 • run though the first half of learn vimscript the hard way to take your vimrc file to the next level.
    ◦ remap jk and kj to <esc> " makes escaping easier
    ◦ remap H to ^ and L to $ " makes end/start of line movement more intuitive.
 • shell loops done with vim:
    ◦ generate the list `ls | vim -`
    ◦ transform the list into commands (regex is very useful here)
    ◦ run it `:w ! sh`
 • modeline (see `:help modeline`)
    ◦ Use this for settings specific to individual files, eg, `// vim:nomodifiable`
